# website
A basic website template - add your custom colors, images and favicons for a single page website.

Requires Node.js installed on your system. Uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for a css library.

You can customize the colors and add additional css in `sass/styles.scss`. To build your index.css file, run `npm run css-build`.
